femto shell program in c language that echoes any command entered by the user. The shell will have only one built-in command "exit". If the user entered "exit", the shell will reply with "Good Bye" and terminate.

Here is an example of the output:

in-> Hello my shell

out-> Hello my shell

in-> what can you do?

out-> what can you do?

in-> You are super

out-> You are super

in-> exit

Good Bye
